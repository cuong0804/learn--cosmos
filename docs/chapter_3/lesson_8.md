# Lesson 8: Making a query through API

Browse 'http://localhost:1310' to learn more about query services

## Guidelines
Query helps you to query information on chain or for debugging

1. start a baby node `bash scripts/test-node-deploy.sh --install`
2. make a transaction through CLI
 * babyd tx bank send test $(babyd keys show test1 -a --keyring-backend test) 500000ubaby --fees 30ubaby -y --node tcp://localhost:2281
3. query balances of receiver through API
 * curl -X GET "http://localhost:1310/cosmos/bank/v1beta1/balances/baby1qte95sa35sduwycg2pu9unkqdw7sytm37h0kss/by_denom?denom=ubaby" -H  "accept: application/json"
