Goal: 
*  Learner should understand three fields in genesis.json (mint, distribution, gov)
*  Learner can check reward balances for validator address

# Lesson 13: Dive deeper into app_state module configuration (mint, distribution, gov)

In this lesson, I will talk about three fields in app_state (mint, distribution, gov) in genesis.json.

* mint: allow for a flexible inflation rate determined by market demand targeting a particular bonded-stake ratio and effect a balance between market liquidity and staked supply.
* distribution: describes a functional way to passively distribute rewards between validators and delegators 
* gov: handles all governance-related transactions

1. In this 'mint' field:

```bash
 "minter": {
        "inflation": "0.130000000000000000",
        "annual_provisions": "0.000000000000000000"
 }
```
* inflation: initial yearly percentage of increase in the total supply of staking token, compounded weekly. A 0.130000000000000000 value means the target is 13% yearly inflation
* annual_provisions: calculated each block. Initialize at 0.000000000000000000

``` bash 
"params": {
        "mint_denom": "ubaby",
        "inflation_rate_change": "0.130000000000000000",
        "inflation_max": "0.200000000000000000",
        "inflation_min": "0.070000000000000000",
        "goal_bonded": "0.670000000000000000",
        "blocks_per_year": "6311520"
 }
```
* mint_denom: Denom of the staking token
* inflation_rate_change: max yearly change in inflation
* inflation_max: maximum level of inflation
* inflation_min: minium level of inflation
* goal_bonded: percentage of the total supply that is targeted to be bonded. If the percentage of bonded staking tokens is below this target, the inflation increases (following inflation_rate_change) until it reaches inflation_max. If the percentage of bonded staking tokens is above this target, the inflation decreases (following inflation_rate_change) until it reaches inflation_min
* blocks_per_year: estimation of the amount of blocks per year. Used to compute the block reward coming from inflated staking token (called block provisions).

2. In this 'distribution' field:

```bash
"params": {
        "community_tax": "0.020000000000000000",
        "base_proposer_reward": "0.010000000000000000",
        "bonus_proposer_reward": "0.040000000000000000",
        "withdraw_addr_enabled": true
 }
```
* community_tax: The tax percentage on fees and block rewards that goes to the community pool
* base_proposer_reward: Base bonus on transaction fees collected in a valid block that goes to the proposer of block. If value is 0.010000000000000000, 1% of the fees go to the proposer
* bonus_proposer_reward: Max bonus on transaction fees collected in a valid block that goes to the proposer of block. The bonus depends on the number of precommits the proposer includes. If the proposer includes 2/3rd precommits weighted by voting power (minimum for the block to be valid), they get a bonus of base_proposer_reward. This bonus increases linearly up to bonus_proposer_reward if the proposer includes 100% of precommits
* withdraw_addr_enabled: If true, delegators can set a different address to withdraw their rewards. Set to false if you want to disable transfers at genesis, as it can be used as a way to get around the restriction.

Command allows users to query validator commission rewards by address:
```bash
babyd query distribution commission [address] [flags]
```
*note: address not bech32 format. format use this case (babyvaloper...)

3. In this 'gov' field:

```bash
      "starting_proposal_id": "1",
      "deposits": [],
      "votes": [],
      "proposals": [],
```
* starting_proposal_id: This parameter defines the ID of the first proposal. Each proposal is identified by a unique ID.
* deposits: List of deposits for each proposal ID. Set to null if genesis was not exported from previous state.
* votes: List of votes for each proposal ID. Set to null if genesis was not exported from previous state.
* proposals: List of proposals for each proposal ID: Set to null if genesis was not exported from previous state.

```bash
"deposit_params": {
        "min_deposit": [
          {
            "denom": "ubaby",
            "amount": "10000000"
          }
        ],
        "max_deposit_period": "172800s"
}
```
* min_deposit: The minimum deposit required for the proposal to enter Voting Period. If multiple denoms are provided, the OR operator applies.
* max_deposit_period: The maximum period (in nanoseconds) after which it is not possible to deposit on the proposal anymore.

```bash
"voting_params": {
    "voting_period": "172800s"
}
```
* voting_period: Length of the voting period.

```bash
"tally_params": {
    "quorum": "0.334000000000000000",
    "threshold": "0.500000000000000000",
    "veto_threshold": "0.334000000000000000"
}
```
* quorum: Minimum percentage of bonded staking tokens that needs to vote for the result to be valid.
* threshold: Minimum percentage of votes that need to be YES for the result to be valid.
* veto_threshold: Maximum percentage NO_WITH_VETO votes for the result to be valid.

## Guidelines

1. initialize a node with field denom in gov = udaddy 
```bash
cat $HOME/.baby/config/genesis.json | jq '.app_state["gov"]["deposit_params"]["min_deposit"][0]["denom"]="udaddy"' > $HOME/.baby/config/tmp_genesis.json && mv $HOME/.baby/config/tmp_genesis.json $HOME/.baby/config/genesis.json
```
2. check genesis.json in ~/.baby/config/genesis.json. gov field should be denom=udaddy

![client configuration](images/denom_gov.png)

3. Run the network
```bash 
scripts/test-node-deploy.sh --continue
```

## Homework
1. Deploy a node with field denom in mint = udaddy successfully

![client configuration](images/log_udaddy.png)

2. Query validator commission rewards successfully
